      <h2 class="spooky">A haunting ceremony</h2>
      <p class="sentimental">October was coming to a close just as our lives together was beginning. At dusk we all met in the park square for the ceremony. My brother and I came down the narrow haunting Savannah street, entering the park we waited in anxious anticpation for the ceremony to begin. From behind the gothic architecture surrounding us, I saw her walking over. She was in a radiant white dress, adorned with flowers in her hair and I felt I was being approached by a magnificent angel. The world slowed to a near stand still, sound escaped me, and the passersby faded away into obscurity all while the colors of the world gleamed all around her. This beautiful woman was to be my wife in mere moments. </p>
